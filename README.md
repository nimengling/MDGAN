# MDGAN

1.requirements

Pytorch == 1.7.0

To run the code, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX3080 GPU video card with 10GB video memory is required.

Software development environment should be any Python integrated development environment used on an NVIDIA video card.

Programming language: Python 3.8.3.

2.How to useï¼Ÿ

First, preprocess the image: Cut 80 digital core slices into 80 * 80 size images and stack sequentially into a tif of 80 * 80 * 80 size as a training image.

Secondly, set the network parameters such as maxsize, batchsize, learning rate and storage location. After configuring the parameters and environment, you can run main.py directly.
